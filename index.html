                In the last year or so I really got into focusing on 
               learing to code. I think I want to become a data scientist.
               My current role does not allow me to code at all, so I 
               have been spending a lot of my free time learning. I 
               have spent time taking Udemy, launcode, and youtube classes on various languages. The languages I have been 
               working to expand my skills on are Python, SQL, JavaScript,
                C#, and HTML.
               </p> 
               <h2>Languages</h2>

               I really like spending time learning new languages. I am 
               currently pretty advanced in spanish. Puedo hablar muy bien 
               en esponol. De hecho pasaba una semestre en Espana! I am also 
               currently working to learn German and Greek. Greek is hard and
               not going so well for me.

               <h2>Crafts</h2>
               <p> 
               <div align = "right">
                  <button id = "back">Back</button>
                  <img height = "200" id = "craftsImg" ></img>
                  <button id = "next">next</button>
               </div>
               I am not sure if crafts is the right word for what I like to do. 
               I like to make wall decor and refurbish chairs. I am currently working
               on fixing up an old chair that my grandmother gave me. However, in the 
               past I have made each of my friends custome wedding presents.
