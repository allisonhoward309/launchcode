            <p> I am not really sure what to write this webpage about. However, one of the suggested itmes was to write about your hobbies. So here is how I spend my free-tim. I hope you enjoy!</p>

                        In the last year or so I really got into focusing on 
                        learing to code. I think I want to become a data scientist.
                        My current role does not allow me to code at all, so I 
                        have been spending a lot of my free time learning. I 
                        have spent time taking Udemy, launcode, and youtube classes on various languages. The languages I have been 
                        working to expand my skills on are Python, SQL, JavaScript,
                        C#, and HTML.

                        I really like spending time learning new languages. I am 
                        currently pretty advanced in spanish. Puedo hablar muy bien 
                        en esponol. De hecho pasaba una semestre en Espana! I am also 
                        currently working to learn German and Greek. Greek is hard and
                        not going so well for me.

                <tr><th> Crafts</th></tr>
                 <tr>

                        <button id = "next" class ="button">next</button>    
                        <img height = "200" id = "craftsImg" ></img>
                        <button id = "back" class = "button">Back</button>
                        I am not sure if crafts is the right word for what I like to do. 
                        I like to make wall decor and refurbish chairs. I am currently working
                        on fixing up an old chair that my grandmother gave me. However, in the 
                        past I have made each of my friends custome wedding presents.
